DPTimeIntervalPicker
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dawiddr/DPTimeIntervalPicker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dawiddr/DPTimeIntervalPicker)

UIDatePicker in CountDownTimer is not customizable. Furthermore, as it is intended 
to be used for countdown timers, it doesn't allow to select the value of 0.

DPTimeIntervalPicker closely resembles the look & fell of UIDatePicker, while allowing
customization of font faces and sizes. It also doesn't impose any limitations on the 
values, allowing to anything from zero to 23 hours 59 minutes to be selected.

**Compatibility:** iOS 8.0+ in all layout size classes
**Language:** Swift (with Objective-C compatibility)

Some functionalities are not yet implemented - see Issues.
