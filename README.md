UIDatePicker in CountDownTimer mode is not customizable. Furthermore, as it is intended 
to be used for countdown timers, it doesn't allow to select the value of 0.

DPTimeIntervalPicker closely resembles its look & fell, while providing customization 
options for font faces and sizes. It also doesn't impose any limitations on the values, 
allowing anything from zero to 23 hours 59 minutes to be selected.

**Compatibility:** iOS 8.0+ in all layout size classes

**Language:** Swift (with Objective-C compatibility)

Some functionalities are not yet implemented - see Issues.
